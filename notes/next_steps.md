# next steps:
- see where i left off, and determine what is needed in order to have this solve cross
- revisit the compression algo, and only implement if that is the last thing needed to solve
- once implemented, create an easy to use demo file showing cross solves
- connect to some type of UI that alreadt exists via API to visualize
- formatter
- linter
- move helper functions to cube
- create make models and solver folders
- once above is done, refactor:
    - pydantic
    - toml
    - uv env
    - break out into classes and file structures
