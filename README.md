# Rubik's Cube Cross Solver

## I am working on developing a Rubik's Cube solver that solves a Rubik's Cube the way I would. I used to compete in tournaments when I was younger (far from the best, but was a fun hobby back in the day). 

### My WCA profile can be founde here: https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013HUSS01

I solve the rubik's cube using the CFOP method (Cross / F2L / OLL / PLL) and average ~15 seconds. This project focuses on the "cross" portion which is less "algorithmic" than other parts of learning the CFOP method. However, I wanted to have a script solve the cross I would using similar logic patterns.

# timeline
- started in novemebr 2023
- worked until ~april 2024
- took break until april 2025
- everything was under dev
- PR to merge dev into main in april 2025
- main is a back up to how it was
- dev will continue to be greatest and latest WIP
- will work on branches and feed into dev
